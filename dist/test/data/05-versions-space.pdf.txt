INTRODUCTION
The epidemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus (severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 - SARS-
CoV-2), which was first identified in Wuhan, a city 
in the Hubei province in China, is being exported to 
a growing number of countries. Early efforts were 
focused on describing the clinical course, counting 
severe cases, and treating the disease
1. 
Covid-19 has 
spread rapidly and has been shown to have a wide 
spectrum of severity. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) has recently declared coronavirus disease 2019 
(Covid-19) a public health emergency of international 
concern
2. 
So far, according to the World Health Organiza-
tion
3, 
COVID-19 has affected globally 1.210.956 indi-
viduals and accounted for over 67.594 deaths.
Since this is a new disease, the scientific community

positive results for SARS-CoV2 on RT-PCR in conjuncti-
val swabs and suggested the possibility of transmission 
through the eyes
7
. Currently, there is no evidence for 
intrauterine vertical transmission of COVID-19
24.
Based on observations of data from the early out-
break in China, the trend of an increasing incidence 
largely follows exponential growth, and the mean 
basic reproduction number (R0) was estimated from 
2.24 to 3.58
20
.
The fraction of undocumented cases with mild, 
limited, or no symptoms is critical to the spread of 
coronavirus. Li et al.
25 
estimated the prevalence and 
contagiousness of these undocumented cases with a 
mathematical model of simulation. They found that 
patients with no reported infection are half as conta-
gious, per individual, as reported ones. However, 86.2% 
(95%CI: 81.5-89.8) of all infections were from undocu-
mented cases. Their simulation predicted that 78.8% of 
reported infections should have been reduced without 
transmission from undocumented cases
25.
Incubation Period
The incubation period is critical to understand the 
infectiousness of COVID-19, its epidemic size, and the 
ideal time for the quarantine period. It is defined as 
the period between the day of infection and the ill-
ness onset. Linton et al.
15  
found an average incuba-
tion period of 5.6 days (95%CI: 5.0,6.3) (n=158). Most 
infected people that present symptoms will do so 
within 12 days of the primary contact and the current 
period of active monitoring (14 days) is well supported 
by the evidence
26.
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms may vary, according to studies, 
due to different samples, the period of analysis of the 
patients, and subjectivity of data. However, this review 
enabled a satisfactory survey of the main signs and 
symptoms. The most common symptoms at the onset 
of illness, according to the case series analyzed and 
represented in Table 2, were fever, cough, myalgia, 
fatigue, sputum production, and dyspnea [Table 2]. 
Some patients had radiographic evidence of pneumo-
nia with bilateral diffuse airspace opacities. Some of 
which needed supplemental oxygen too
6. 
Less com-
mon symptoms included hemoptysis, abdominal pain, 
diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting
5
. Sore throat and nasal 
congestion occurred in only around 5-10% of patients
22
. 
Neurological signs and symptoms were also described, 
such as headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, 
is engaged in new research that better explains the 
pathophysiology, diagnosis, clinical course, and treat-
ment of coronavirus. Many works are published daily 
showing different outcomes of the disease, mainly 
regarding the symptoms and the treatment, which does 
not have one specific path so far, making it difficult 
to follow and understand the updates. This study will 
discuss information on what we know about Covid-19 
so far to summarize and facilitate the access to infor-
mation and a better understanding of this pandemic in 
order to contribute to the medical community in the 
decision-making and direct new studies on issues that 
remain limited about SARS-CoV2.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our study brings whats is known about the corona-
virus so far and aims to gather essential information to 
better understand this pandemic and help on the next 
steps that the scientific community must take. This 
is a review article that brings collected information 
from different articles published since the beginning 
of the epidemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus [Pubmed 
“covid-19”; “coronavirus”; “H1N1 infection”]. There 
were no date or language restrictions. Information 
was collected in cohort studies (4), case series (11), 
non-randomized clinical trials (1), review articles (7), 
and others. The search was for information about the 
epidemiology, rate of infection, hospital care, incuba-
tion period, signs and symptoms, risk factors, con-
founding factors, and current treatment. The majority 
of the data on COVID-19 come from Asia. The elec-
tronic databases were last searched on 06 April 2020. 
The main papers used are listed in Table 1
.
 
RESULTS
Rate of Infection
At the beginning of the outbreak, an association 
between the origin of COVID- 19 and the wet animal 
market in Wuhan City, where live animals are routinely 
sold, was identified
19
. But after the progression of the 
virus, the person-to-person transmission became the 
most important way of transmission. It occurs pri-
marily via direct contact or through droplets spread 
by the coughing or sneezing of an infected individ-
ual
19
. Recently, SARS-Cov-2 was isolated from feces of 
patients with Covid-19 by Chinese researchers, indi-
cating the potential of fecal-oral transmission
24
. More-
over, a study detected a low prevalence of patients with

analyzed some confirmed or very sus-
pected cases of COVID-19 to see what are the ocular 
manifestations and its relation with coronavirus dis-
ease. They concluded that 31.6% (95% CI: 17.5-48.7) of 
the patients had ocular abnormalities which are more 
prevalent in severe (dyspnea, blood oxygen saturation 
of 93% or less) or critical cases (respiratory failure or

shock or multiple organ dysfunction). The most com-
mon ocular symptoms were conjunctivitis, conjunctival 
hyperemia, epiphora, chemosis, and increased secre-
tions. In addition, those patients had higher white blood 
cell, neutrophil, procalcitonin, C-reaction protein, and 
lactate dehydrogenase
7.
Laboratorial parameters may be useful to help the 
diagnosis, but the virus isolation and viral nucleic acid 
detection are the exams that confirm the infection. 
Other nonspecific parameters may be helpful, mainly 
in the early stage of the disease, like leukopenia, or 
a normal number of leukocytes with lymphopenia 
or increased monocytes
21
. A procalcitonin, C-reac-
tion protein, or lactate dehydrogenase increase also 
appears in COVID-19 infection
7.
Image abnormalities could appear in COVID-19 
infection and vary with age, underlying diseases, 
immunity, and stage of the infection at the moment 
of scanning. Some patterns at the chest X-ray or CT 
Scan are multiple small patchy shadows, interstitial 
changes, bilateral multiple ground-glass opacity, infil-
trating shadows, and pulmonary consolidation
21.
Risk Factors
Although most patients are thought to have a favor-
able prognosis, older ones and those with chronic 
underlying conditions may have worse outcomes
16
.
A study in China reported the clinical characteris-
tics and risk factors associated with developing acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after hospi-
tal admission and progression from ARDS to death 
in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The study 
shows that older age (≥65 years old), high fever (≥39 
°C), comorbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes), neu-
trophilia, lymphocytopenia, elevated end-organ related 
indices, elevated inflammation-related indices, and 
elevated coagulation function–related indicators were 
significantly associated with higher risks of unfavor-
able outcomes and the development of ARDS
16.
Hospital care x Intensive care unit
In a study from China, they obtained data regarding 
clinical symptoms and outcomes for 1099 patients. A 
primary outcome event occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), 
including 5.0% who were admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU), 2.3% who underwent invasive mechan-
ical ventilation, and 1.4% who died
2
.
In another observational study in China with 158 
patients, they found that the average time from ill-
ness onset to hospital admission was different for 
living and deceased cases, the former was estimated 
at 3.3 days (95%CI:2.7,4.0) and the latter was 6.5 days 
(95%CI:5.2,8.0)
15
. The mean time from hospitalization 
to death was 8.8 days (95%CI:7.2,10.8)
15
.
Mortality
Studies conducted with Chinese patients showed a 
mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided 
by the reported cases) of 3.6%
28
. According to the WHO 
data until 06 March 2020, the rate is also between 
3-4%
29
. A retrospective cohort with 191 patients found 
that older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assess-
ment (SOFA) score, and d-dimer greater than 1um/mL 
at admission were associated with higher in-hospital 
death risk
17
.
However, those estimated mortality rates are 
not representative of the actual death rate because 
the actual number of infected patients could not 
be identified. Not all cases are tested, including 
most asymptomatic ones or patients with very mild 
symptoms. Therefore, the mortality rate is proba-
bly overestimated
18
.
Confounding factors - Differential Diagnosis
The infection by SARS-CoV-2 causes many non-
specific symptoms that are shared by other infectious 
diseases of the respiratory tract, like influenza, parain-
fluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, 
rhinovirus, and others previously-known human coro-
naviruses. The diagnosis cannot be definitively made 
without microbiologic testing
8,21
.
Current treatment
Until this moment, there are no specific antiviral 
drugs or vaccines against the COVID-19 infection for 
potential therapy in humans. One of the options avail-
able is the use of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs like 
nucleoside analogs and HIV-protease inhibitors, which 
could attenuate virus infection
19
.
A great deal of effort has been made to find effec-
tive drugs against the virus in China. The State Council 
of China held a news briefing indicating that chloro-
quine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine sulfate 
(HCQ), old drugs used for the treatment of malaria, had 
demonstrated efficacy and acceptable safety in treating 
COVID-19-associated pneumonia in multicenter clini-
cal trials conducted in China
30
. The oral absorption of 
both drugs in humans is very efficient. As in the case of 
SARS-CoV, the virus transport of SARS-CoV2 from endo-
somes to endolysosome appears to be a requirement to 

WHAT DO WE knOW ABOUT COVID-19?  A REVIEW ARTIClE
REV ASSOC MED BRAS 2020; 66(4):534-540538
release the viral genome, and both CQ and HCQ have 
been able to block it. The anti-SARS-CoV2 activity seems 
to be more potent with CQ; however, HCQ has been 
shown to be much less toxic than it. Until now, the 
inhibition of SARS-CoV2 in vitro has been efficient with 
HCQ using a safe dosage but this awaits confirmation 
by clinical trials
31
.
Gautret and collaborators conducted an open-label 
non-randomized clinical trial to investigate the effect 
of HCQ and Azithromycin in virological clearance, 
clinical follow-up, and occurrence of side-effects in 
patients with COVID-19 infection. In this study, 26 
patients received HCQ (200mg three times per day for 
ten days) and 16 were the control group. Among the 
patients treated with HCQ, six received Azithromycin 
(500mg on day 1, followed by 250mg per day, for the 
next four days). The results were very promising; at 
day 6 post-inclusion, the group treated with both drugs 
had 100% of virological cure compared with 57,1% of 
patients treated with HCQ only, and 12,5% with no 
drugs. Further works are needed to investigate these 
effects with a greater sample and a longer follow up, 
but also to investigate potential side effects (QT pro-
longation, ventricular arrhythmia, and retinopathy)
18
.
The convalescent plasma containing neutralizing 
antibodies or immunoglobulins has been used as a last 
resource to improve the clinical conditions of patients 
with ARDS. Moreover, studies have shown a shorter 
hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated 
with convalescent plasma than in those who were not 
treated with it
9,23
.
An effective treatment is an urgent need to treat 
symptomatic cases and decrease the transmission 
of coronavirus in the community by reducing the 
virus carriage
18
.
Public health and economic impacts
In the absence of a Covid-19 vaccine or proven and 
safe treatment, our better protection against coronavi-
rus is social isolation. This measure aims to decrease 
contact rates in the population in order to reduce the 
transmission of the virus. Quarantine brings enor-
mous social and economic costs in the short, mid, or 
long-term
32
.
 
Many countries made hard decisions to control 
this epidemic. China locked down whole cities, Italy 
imposed severe restrictions on the population, and the 
United States subjected part of the country to quaran-
tine and part to a recommended “self-quarantine” and 
banned non-US nationals from entering the country
33
.
DISCUSSION
Knowledge about the 2019 novel coronavirus 
remains limited, but we need to learn and collect qual-
ity information about this clinical threat to deal and 
respond to the consequences of the pandemic.
The infection by COVID-19 is gradually being eluci-
dated by the scientific community, contributing to new 
steps towards the control of the disease and the search 
for its treatment. According to this study review, coro-
navirus has an infection rate (R0) that varies between 
2 and 3 people and an incubation period of around 
5.6 days. This information is essential for the deve-
lopment of preventive measures and epidemiological 
simulations.
 
It is important to highlight that the rate of infec-
tion and death are very different within the coun-
tries. This might be caused because each country 
followed different protocols. Some with early per-
son-to-person isolation, others with vertical isolation, 
and others with no isolation. Another possible cause 
of this huge difference in the infection and death 
rates are the capability of each country to test their 
individuals. While some are testing all individuals 
at risk, others have no epidemiologic, economic, 
and political condition to do the same, thus causing 
unreliable data and underreporting of the disease in 
most countries.
The disease presents, in most cases, with fever, 
cough, myalgia, fatigue, and dyspnea, but it has a 
wide spectrum of severity, which can cause respira-
tory failure and require ICU admission for advanced 
ventilatory support. Knowing the natural history 
of the disease is essential to think about possible 
treatments and prepare the health system in the 
most appropriate way, such as increasing ICU beds 
and respirators.
As most studies in the literature are quite recent 
and use different methodologies, this review aims to 
facilitate the dissemination of knowledge among sci-
entists and health care professionals through clear 
data and information.
The most effective way to prevent the disease so 
far is social isolation, which aims to reduce the rate 
of disease transmission. However, this decision also 
leads to economic issues and we must not be blind 
to these effects of the pandemic. Countries with 
major economic influence in the world are stopping 
all activities for at least 14 days. This may increase 
the unemployment rate and the indebtedness of 
the countries.

LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
Our study has some limitations because different 
types of studies were analyzed (observational, experi-
mental, review articles, clinical trials) but most of the 
information was consistent between them. Another 
limitation is the short review time for these papers, 
considering the urgent need for the infection diagno-
sis, treatment, and pathogenesis.
 
CONCLUSION
During a pandemic, scientific knowledge advances 
in an accelerated way. In the race for rapid epidemic 
control, every minute is important and discoveries 
cannot be delayed. Governments and health author-
ities are under increased pressure to control the 
COVID-19 spreading. In this scenario, the scientific 
community is working hard to produce relevant 
papers which will help in the next steps against the 
coronavirus. Our review summarized clearly the latest 
news about SARS-CoV2, evidencing what we know 
about COVID-19 until now.  Further studies are needed 
to fill the existing gaps in this epidemic knowledge.
